# qasouthwest_tests

This repo is built using Meta AI as the QA Tester for the webpage QASouthwest.com
The test framework will be Cucumber, Java, Jenkins, AWS EC2, AWS S3, and Jira.

This is and experiment to see how far the AI can go as a tester.  We expect to be 80% of the test cases, code, execution, data and appraoch to come from AI.

We will use Human in the middle as we will use only 1 QA expert with over 26 years of experience in the industry to guide and prompt the AI as an SDET.
